## SoccRestart

SoccRestart is a respository made for the simple and plain use of bypassing school restrictions. Once started out with "VorShift" has become this. I believe this may be a big project someday, and I hope there will be just as big a community. SoccRestart is made by [DelvFTF](https://github.com/upchuckle) for the satisfactory of pissing of schools, and making students happy. The owner of SoccRestart also owns a [google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mtN-fS-QTqqTfZf9CkfLBNWG-YMHWn9GDHcegx6C7q8/edit?tab=t.0) with the same sole purpose as this. This project is possible with the main helper, [Potato](https://github.com/dragon731012) and the inspirement from [Blobby Boi](https://github.com/blobby-boi).

## Who is Potato?

Potato is a high school programmer, and a huge help to this respository. He made the [gold-proxy](https://github.com/Wheels522/gold-proxy), as shown in the folders, and [Innate](https://github.com/dragon731012/Innate), which you make not know of. Because of him, I was able to make this respository.
